# CraftNectar-Fabric

This is the official modpack for the CraftNectar server.

## How do I play?

1. Download the modpack zip file, and import it into your favorite launcher. (Curse, Prism, AT Launcher, etc.)
2. Using the instance you just downloaded, ensure you've allocated at least 6GB (8GB reccomended, but never use more than half your RAM on minecraft) and make sure your instance is using java version 8.
3. Open the instance and connect to `craft.divnectar.com`

## I want to contribute to the pack

Great! We'd love your contribution. If you know anything about git and terminals, it's easy as pie. Simply clone the repo for the modpack. Ensure you have Packwiz installed on your system, then use the Packwiz documentation to learn how to add mods to the modpack. When you are done editing, please submit a pull request for your mod additions and they will be considered.

We are open to all community submissions, so long as it isn't too resource intensive or makes players overpowered.
